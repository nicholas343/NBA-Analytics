# NBA-Analytics

## I have a deep passion for sports. I play basketball and I enjoy watching the sport as well. I have always wanted to use my experience with coding to analyze trends within the NBA.

## This project will use different libraries and functions within Python to analyze statistics for players in the NBA. 
## This will be done in Jupyter Notebook and the data will be taken from an online data source.

## The libraries that I used for this project include requests, pandas, os, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, sklearn.linear_model, mpl_toolkits.mplot3d, and scipy.interpolate.
