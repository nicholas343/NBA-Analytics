# NBA-Analytics

## I have a deep passion for sports. I play basketball and I enjoy watching the sport as well. I have always wanted to use my experience with coding to analyze trends within the NBA.

## I will be webscraping data for NBA players in order to gather enough information for my analysis. This data will be up-to-date and will include categories to organize it. I will look at different graphs and data analysis methods to study the data as best as possible.

## To obtain a greater level of specificity, I will focus on two elements of the stats that I will evaluate. I want to look at Field Goals Made (FGM) and Free Throws Made (FTM). Field Goals Made are attempted shots by players that go into the basket and conntribute to two or three points. Free Throws Made are attempted free throws that make it into the basket and count as one point. The goal of this study is to show that there is a positive correlation between Field Goals Made and Free Throws Made for players in the NBA. I want to study these two aspects due to my observations of NBA players and ther statistics. I have noticed that many of the best NBA players who tend to make many shots also tend to make many free throws.

## This project will use different libraries and functions within Python to analyze statistics for players in the NBA. 
## This will be done in Jupyter Notebook and the data will be taken from an online data source.

## The libraries that I used for this project include requests, pandas, os, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, sklearn.linear_model, mpl_toolkits.mplot3d, and scipy.interpolate.
