# NBA-Analytics

## This project will use different libraries and functions within Python to analyze statistics for players in the NBA. 
## This will be done in Jupyter Notebook and the data will be taken from an online data source.

##Libraries that I used for this project include requests, pandas, os, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, sklearn.linear_model, mpl_toolkits.mplot3d, and scipy.interpolate.
